## Features ✨

- **RESTful API**: Endpoints for managing coupons and user authentication.
- **CORS Enabled**: Configured to allow connections from the Netlify-deployed frontend.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Robust middleware for handling errors and logging requests.
- **Secure Authentication**: Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **CORS**: Middleware to allow cross-origin requests.
- **Other Packages**: Refer to `package.json` for the complete list of dependencies.

## Installation ⚙️

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository** 📂
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coupon-hub-backend.git
   cd coupon-hub-backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies** 📦
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` File** 🌍

   In the root directory, create a `.env` file with the following variables (modify values as needed):

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   CLIENT_ORIGIN=https://your-netlify-app.netlify.app
   ```

   - **PORT**: The port on which the server will run.
   - **DATABASE_URL**: Your database connection string (if applicable).
   - **JWT_SECRET**: Secret key for JWT authentication.
   - **CLIENT_ORIGIN**: The URL of your Netlify-deployed frontend to enable CORS.

## Development 🏗️

To run the server locally:

- **Standard Start** ▶️
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
  This command starts the server on the port specified in your `.env` file (default is 5000).

- **Development Mode** (with auto-reload if using a tool like nodemon) 🔄
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

## Deployment 🚀

### Backend Deployment on Render 🌍

The backend is deployed on Render. When you push changes to your repository, Render will automatically install dependencies and run the start script defined in your `package.json`. Make sure to configure the necessary environment variables in the Render dashboard.

### Frontend Deployment on Netlify 🌐

The frontend is deployed on Netlify. Since the backend uses CORS, ensure that the `CLIENT_ORIGIN` environment variable matches the URL of your Netlify deployment. This allows secure communication between your frontend and backend.
